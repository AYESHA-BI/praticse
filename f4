A Content Management System (CMS) is software that enables users to create, manage, edit, and publish digital content, primarily for websites, without needing advanced technical or coding skills. It acts as a centralized interface for teams to collaborate, utilizing templates for design consistency and offering role-based permissions for secure, efficient content workflows.
